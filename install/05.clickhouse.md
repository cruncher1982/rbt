## Install ClickHouse

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you use VM, set CPU type to "HOST" for this VM. (Recommended CPU is at least Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E2690v4)

```bash
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates dirmngr
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 8919F6BD2B48D754
echo "deb https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb lts main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -y clickhouse-server clickhouse-client
```

[default password is: ```qqq```]

Modify some "default" parameters

```bash
ln -sf /opt/rbt/install/clickhouse/log.xml /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/log.xml
```

## Known issues

If you have problems writing data to the ```plog``` table (events in the mobile app), then try running next query:

```clickhouse
SELECT isValidJSON('{}')
```

If you get the error message:

```
DB::Exception: Couldn't allocate 2 bytes when parsing JSON: In scope SELECT isValidJSON('{}'). (CANNOT_ALLOCATE_MEMORY)
```

make sure you set the CPU type to "HOST" if you are using a VM.

If that doesn't help, or you are not using a VM, then the server probably has an old CPU.
In this case, try disabling the ```simdjson``` library,
go to ```/etc/clickhouse-server/users.xml```
and add ```<allow_simdjson>0</allow_simdjson>``` to the default profile settings, then restart the service.
You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60661#issuecomment-1979949562)
and [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/66045#issuecomment-2258550489).

## Configure ClickHouse

We strongly recommend making some changes to the server configuration file ```/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml```,
namely: change the logging level from "trace" to "warning" and specify TTL for the system tables "*_log".
Otherwise, you will waste disk space, because by default the growth
of [system tables](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/system-tables/overview) is unlimited.

By running this query in ClickHouse, you can see how much disk space the system tables are currently taking up:

```clickhouse
SELECT table,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) AS total_size,
       sum(rows)                              AS total_rows
FROM system.parts
WHERE database = 'system'
GROUP BY table
ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC;
```

Find ```<level>trace</level>``` and set it to "warning". Also find ```<*_log>...</*_log>``` sections and specify there
```<ttl>event_date + INTERVAL 3 DAY</ttl>```. Instead of 3 days, you can use the desired TTL. A more detailed example
can be found [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/system-tables/overview#system-tables-introduction).

Restart ClickHouse after editing the configuration:

```bash
systemctl restart clickhouse-server
```

After starting, ClickHouse will recreate the system tables, and you can drop old tables **with a numeric suffix**. For
example:

```clickhouse
DROP TABLE system.query_log_0;
DROP TABLE system.part_log_0;
```

After [8 minutes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/undrop) the data will be deleted from the disk.
